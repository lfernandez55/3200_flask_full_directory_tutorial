This repo contains a skeleton flask app where templates, views, models and forms are all distributed into their own
folders.  It is running some very minimum wtforms and sqlalchemy models and queries that verify all those
 libraries are working.

To run/deploy it:

venv\scripts\activate.bat

pip install -r requirements.txt

flask run
